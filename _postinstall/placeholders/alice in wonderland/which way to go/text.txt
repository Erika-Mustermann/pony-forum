ALICE
    Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?

CHESHIRE CAT
    That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.

ALICE
    I don't much care where---

CHESHIRE CAT
    Then it doesn't matter which way you go.

ALICE
    ---so long as I get *somewhere*.

CHESHIRE CAT
    Oh, you're sure to do that, if you only walk long enough.
